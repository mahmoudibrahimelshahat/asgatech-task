Hello Guys,
My Name is Mahmoud Ibrahim Frontend Developer with 2 year experience .

Tools :
-----
Html - scss - Tailwind - Angular - Angular Material - ngx-toastr - ngx-loader 

Version :
-----

Angular -> 17.3.7
Node -> 20.13.1

I want to explain some Notes: 
----------------------------

1- there is alot of data so it must be exist page and pageSize and length on each call api (I solve it in product page)
2- about edit quantity i can't edit on json file so solution -> 
    1 - make json like ts file and make it export 
    2 - use Json-server 
3- i didn't call getOrderById cause i already do Function that can get user and product details in order and put data in state on route like transform data
    into url 
3- btw it is json file so i don't make add Api cause i can't add in Json file (i could use Json-server)
